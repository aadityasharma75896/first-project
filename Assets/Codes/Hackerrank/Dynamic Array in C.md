### üìñ Statement

Snow Howler is the librarian at the central library of the city of HuskyLand. He must handle requests which come in the following forms:

1 x y : Insert a book with  pages at the end of the xth shelf.

2 x y : Print the number of pages in the xth book on the yth shelf.

3 x : Print the number of books on the xth shelf.

Snow Howler has got an assistant, Oshie, provided by the Department of Education. Although inexperienced, Oshie can handle all of the queries of types 2 and 3.

Help Snow Howler deal with all the queries of type 1.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer total_number_of_shelves, the number of shelves in the library.
The second line contains an integer total_number_of_queries, the number of requests.
Each of the following total_number_of_queries lines contains a request in one of the three specified formats.

Output Format

Write the logic for the requests of type 1. The logic for requests of types 2 and 3 are provided.

Sample Input 0

5<br>
5<br>
1 0 15<br>
1 0 20<br>
1 2 78<br>
